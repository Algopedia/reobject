### Contributing Guidelines

Here are a few ways you can contribute:

- Check the `bitesize` tag for beginner-level issues.
- Add API documentation.
- Improving the test coverage.
- Propose/implement enhancements.

#### Pull Requests
I would like to have a 100% acceptance rate for pull requests. Here is what you can do to help me achieve that:

- Write short and meaningful commit messages. Include the GitHub issue ID if it exists.
  Example: `[GH-7] Add support for imaginary feature` 
- Keep PEP8 fixes (if any) in a separate commit.
- Make sure your patches include a proof of fix, aka unit tests.
- Add or update relevant documentation.

#### Bugs
If you are reporting a bug, please remember to:

- Add examples for both current behavior and expected behavior.
- Include steps to reliably reproduce the bug.
- Include your Python version: `python --version`
